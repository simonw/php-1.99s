  This corresponds to the log.html application used for dbm-based logging.

Feb. 19 Version 1.99d
- The rewritten ParseEscapes function was broken in a major away (patch c1)
- Logging bugs (patches c2 and c3)

Feb. 12 Version 1.99c
- Oops.  Fixed small bug in msql_regcase()
- Fixed documentation bugs in doc/doc.html
- Replaced hard-coded '$' references with VAR_INIT_CHAR (defined in php.h)
- Added mkdir() function
- msql() function now only returns -1 on an error.  0 is returned if query
  didn't return anything (and wasn't supposed to) and a positive integer
  is returned if a result pointer was allocated.  (doc.html updated to reflect 
  this)
- Fixed log.html bug
- Fixed bug in logging related to log.html bug
- Added .phtml (Apache cgi_redirect_module check to log.html)
- Fixed isset() parser bug and related potential core dump in var.c
- Changed documentation to reflect new location of GD library 
  (www.boutell.com/gd)
- Wrote more descriptive chapter on Apache httpd and how to configure
  a cgi redirection module with Apache
- Memory handling changes to _RegReplace function in reg.c - fixed potential
  memory leak
- Wrote long chapter in doc.html on how to add your own functions to PHP/FI
- Added @ (no error printing) version of fopen call
- Fixed silly coredump in fopen() function
- Fixed file upload bug - normal form fields are not url encoded when they
  come as part of the form-data in an upload.  I had incorrectly assumed
  that they would be encoded and attempted to decode them.
- Fixed AddSlashes bug which caused memory corruption when special characters
  needed to be escaped - lots of memory weirdness here.  Hopefully it is 
  clean now.
- Rewrote ParseEscapes function in echo.c - Another source of memory 
  allocation confusion cleared up.

Feb. 5 Version 1.99b 
- Fixed #if -> #ifdef typo in mime.c
- Added check to OpenFile() to disallow loading files that look like temporary
  files from the File Upload function
- Added check for a MAX_FILE_SIZE variable to be defined as a hidden field
  before the file field in a file upload form.  If present, it gives the max
  size in bytes an uploaded file may be.
- Cleaned up error reporting a bit
- Fixed year 2000 bug in date() function
- Added install question to query whether or not file upload support is desired
- Added a "BROKEN_CONFIG_PW" #define to php.h for those people who cannot
  get ?config to accept their password no matter what they do.
- Windows versions of NetScape seem to send the full local pathname of a
  file in the file upload feature - added code to only store the last component
  of this path.
- Added #if LOGGING code around Logging lines in acc.c to fix compile problem
  when access control is selected without logging
- Fixed putenv-free bug in file.c - Thanks to Kenneth Holmlund for finding this 
  one
- Added \n \r \t processing to "header" command
- Added $$variable syntax to support variable variable names
- Did more work on the NSAPI support - still not functional yet
- Initial work for supporting Empress (a full commercial RDBMS)
- Made msql() function return "-1" on a failed query
- New internal variable: $phperrmsg - This will contain any error message that
  may be generated by PHP.  Especially useful in conjunction with the '@'
  character which hides error messages from being shown from certain functions
- Fixed logging bug related to "include" command
- Made msql_regcase() a bit smarter so it doesn't do [11][22] for example
- Added stuff to doc/doc.html
- Added chmod(), chown() and chgrp() native PHP functions

Jan. 24 Version 1.99a (Not quite ready to call it 2.0 yet)
- Fixed floating point multiplication bug
- Fixed Guestbook bug
- Fixed SecureVar() bug
- Fixed core dump which happened when running PHP from the command line
  and the file the file argument pointed to did not exist
- Added setshowinfo() and setlogging() functions to be able to enable/disable
  logging and info blocks from within a script as opposed to having to use
  the ?config screen to do it
- Actual log entry is done after page is loaded now both in order for
  setlogging() to work and for performance reasons
- Fixed bug in CheckType function which would incorrectly cast a posted
  variable like "-0.5" to be a string instead of a double.
- Fixed bug in lex.c which prevented something like: $a = .05; from parsing 
  correctly
- Added usleep() function
- Fixed \\" bug.  Two backslashes followed by a quote character would
  mess up parsing from thereon.
- Removed the StripSlashes() call right before the msqlQuery() call in msql.c.
  We don't want the slashes stripped at this point.
- Added a MAGIC_QUOTE #define to php.h.  If MAGIC_QUOTES is defined, then the
  single quote (') character will automatically be escaped when it is found
  in a variable which comes from either a GET or a POST method form.
- Added File Upload support.
- Finally fixed the bug which caused the page counter to be stuck at 1 for the first
  two hits on a page.
- log filenames are no longer based on inodes, but on the actual filename.
  *NOTE* This makes logs from previous versions incompatible!
- Fixed a number of logging related bugs which could potentially have caused core
  dumps in earlier versions.
- Added a default password of "php" to the ?config screen.  This password will be
  used in case the getpwuid() call to get a user's alphanumeric user id fails.
  ie. if you run PHP ?config for the first time and your user id does not work
  as your password, try entering: php

Dec. 8 Version 1.99

  (the wrong filename was showing up in the error message)
- Added "table.field" syntax for getting results of joins in msql_result()
  function
- When a variable is used as both indexed and unindexed, the unindexed
  contents is synomymous with index "0" - Using a veriable in this manner
  core dumped php previously
- Small change to the FixFilename() function to load file.htm if file.html
  is not found and file.htm is present
- Added SecureVar() function to be able to mark variables as not being allowed
  to be set by the GET method.  This is to prevent people from faking variable
  settings in secure environments.
- Added BinDec() function to convert a string representing a binary number to 
  decimal
- Added DecBin() function to convert a long integer to a binary number in a 
  string

- Added Fopen(), Fclose(), Fgets(), Fputs(), Rewind(), Ftell() and Fseek()
  functions for manipulating text files

  using the mmap() system call.  This will improve performance on all
  page loads, but will be most apparent on pages with while loops with
  many iterations.
- Fixed long-standing bug related to initial access logging
- Removed **, // and %% operators.  They didn't make much sense and only
  served to make the parser more complex than necessary

- Minor fixes to survey.html and guestbook.html examples.  ie. replace strval()
  with intval() calls
- Made PHP script error message reporting more informative.  The actual
  character which triggered the error is highlighted now.

- VAR_INIT_CHAR definition in php.h to allow customization of variable
  designation character

  ('make parser' to generate parse.c if you need to)
